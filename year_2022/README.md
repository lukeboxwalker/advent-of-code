## Prolog 🎅

Santa's reindeer typically eat regular reindeer food, but they need a lot of [magical energy](https://adventofcode.com/2018/day/25) to deliver presents on Christmas. For that, their favorite snack is a special type of <b>star</b> fruit that only grows deep in the jungle. The Elves have brought you on their annual expedition to the grove where the fruit grows.
<p>To supply enough magical energy, the expedition needs to retrieve a minimum of <b>fifty stars</b> by December 25th. Although the Elves assure you that the grove has plenty of fruit, you decide to grab any fruit you see along the way, just in case.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <b>one star</b>. Good luck!</p>
