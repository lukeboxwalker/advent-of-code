Parts are even still volcanically active; small hydrothermal vents release smoke into the caves that slowly <span title="This was originally going to be a puzzle about watersheds, but we're already under water.">settles like rain</span>.</p>
<p>If you can model how the smoke flows through the caves, you might be able to avoid it and be that much safer. The submarine generates a heightmap of the floor of the nearby caves for you (your puzzle input).</p>
<p>Smoke flows to the lowest point of the area it's in. For example, consider the following heightmap:</p>
<pre><code>2<b>1</b>9994321<b>0</b>
3987894921
98<b>5</b>6789892
8767896789
989996<b>5</b>678
</code></pre>
<p>Each number corresponds to the height of a particular location, where <code>9</code> is the highest and <code>0</code> is the lowest a location can be.</p>
<p>Your first goal is to find the <b>low points</b> - the locations that are lower than any of its adjacent locations. Most locations have four adjacent locations (up, down, left, and right); locations on the edge or corner of the map have three or two adjacent locations, respectively. (Diagonal locations do not count as adjacent.)</p>
<p>In the above example, there are <b>four</b> low points, all highlighted: two are in the first row (a <code>1</code> and a <code>0</code>), one is in the third row (a <code>5</code>), and one is in the bottom row (also a <code>5</code>). All other locations on the heightmap have some lower adjacent location, and so are not low points.</p>
<p>The <b>risk level</b> of a low point is <b>1 plus its height</b>. In the above example, the risk levels of the low points are <code>2</code>, <code>1</code>, <code>6</code>, and <code>6</code>. The sum of the risk levels of all low points in the heightmap is therefore <code><b>15</b></code>.</p>
<p>Find all of the low points on your heightmap. <b>What is the sum of the risk levels of all low points on your heightmap?</b></p>
