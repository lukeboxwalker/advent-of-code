You go inside.</p>
<p>It doesn't take long to find the gondolas, but there seems to be a problem: they're not moving.</p>
<p>"Aaah!"</p>
<p>You turn around to see a slightly-greasy Elf with a wrench and a look of surprise. "Sorry, I wasn't expecting anyone! The gondola lift isn't working right now; it'll still be a while before I can fix it." You offer to help.</p>
<p>The engineer explains that an engine part seems to be missing from the engine, but nobody can figure out which one. If you can <b>add up all the part numbers</b> in the engine schematic, it should be easy to work out which part is missing.</p>
<p>The engine schematic (your puzzle input) consists of a visual representation of the engine. There are lots of numbers and symbols you don't really understand, but apparently <b>any number adjacent to a symbol</b>, even diagonally, is a "part number" and should be included in your sum. (Periods (<code>.</code>) do not count as a symbol.)</p>
<p>Here is an example engine schematic:</p>
<pre><code>467..114..
...*......
..35..633.
......#...
617*......
.....+.58.
..592.....
......755.
...$.*....
.664.598..
</code></pre>
<p>In this schematic, two numbers are <b>not</b> part numbers because they are not adjacent to a symbol: <code>114</code> (top right) and <code>58</code> (middle right). Every other number is adjacent to a symbol and so <b>is</b> a part number; their sum is <code><b>4361</b></code>.</p>
<p>Of course, the actual engine schematic is much larger. <b>What is the sum of all of the part numbers in the engine schematic?</b></p>
