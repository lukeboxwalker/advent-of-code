## Prolog ðŸŽ…

<p>Something is wrong with global snow production, and you've been selected to take a look. The Elves have even given you a map; on it, they've used stars to mark the top fifty locations that are likely to be having problems.</p>
<p>You've been doing this long enough to know that to restore snow operations, you need to check all <b>fifty stars</b> by December 25th.</p>
<p>Collect stars by solving puzzles.  Two puzzles will be made available on each day in the Advent calendar; the second puzzle is unlocked when you complete the first.  Each puzzle grants <b>one star</b>. Good luck!</p>
