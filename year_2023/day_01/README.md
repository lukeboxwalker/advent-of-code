<h1>Day 1: Trebuchet?! üéÑ</h1><p>Copyright (c) Eric Wastl</p><a href=https://adventofcode.com/2023/day/1>Link to Day 1</a><h2>Part One üéÅ</h2>
<p>You try to ask why they can't just use a <a href="/2015/day/1">weather machine</a> ("not powerful enough") and where they're even sending you ("the sky") and why your map looks mostly blank ("you sure ask a lot of questions") <span title="My hope is that this abomination of a run-on sentence somehow conveys the chaos of being hastily loaded into a trebuchet.">and</span> hang on did you just say the sky ("of course, where do you think snow comes from") when you realize that the Elves are already loading you into a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trebuchet" target="_blank">trebuchet</a> ("please hold still, we need to strap you in").</p>
<p>As they're making the final adjustments, they discover that their calibration document (your puzzle input) has been <b>amended</b> by a very young Elf who was apparently just excited to show off her art skills. Consequently, the Elves are having trouble reading the values on the document.</p>
<p>The newly-improved calibration document consists of lines of text; each line originally contained a specific <b>calibration value</b> that the Elves now need to recover. On each line, the calibration value can be found by combining the <b>first digit</b> and the <b>last digit</b> (in that order) to form a single <b>two-digit number</b>.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<pre><code>1abc2
pqr3stu8vwx
a1b2c3d4e5f
treb7uchet
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values of these four lines are <code>12</code>, <code>38</code>, <code>15</code>, and <code>77</code>. Adding these together produces <code><b>142</b></code>.</p>
<p>Consider your entire calibration document. <b>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</b></p>

<h2>Part Two üéÅ</h2><p>Your calculation isn't quite right. It looks like some of the digits are actually <b>spelled out with letters</b>: <code>one</code>, <code>two</code>, <code>three</code>, <code>four</code>, <code>five</code>, <code>six</code>, <code>seven</code>, <code>eight</code>, and <code>nine</code> <b>also</b> count as valid "digits".</p>
<p>Equipped with this new information, you now need to find the real first and last digit on each line. For example:</p>
<pre><code>two1nine
eightwothree
abcone2threexyz
xtwone3four
4nineeightseven2
zoneight234
7pqrstsixteen
</code></pre>
<p>In this example, the calibration values are <code>29</code>, <code>83</code>, <code>13</code>, <code>24</code>, <code>42</code>, <code>14</code>, and <code>76</code>. Adding these together produces <code><b>281</b></code>.</p>
<p><b>What is the sum of all of the calibration values?</b></p>
